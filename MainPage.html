	<p>
	&emsp;&emsp;I am <em>Rogienhel Velasco Fernandez</em>, 21 years of age, turning 22 this June 23, 2000.
	Living in Baybay Polong Binmaley, Pangasinan. I am a graduating student in BS Mathematics major in CIT at
	<a href = "College.html" target = "_balnk">Pangasinan State University</a>, Lingayen Campus.
	My hobby is to make my life challenging, challenges makes me feel like knowing something new again.
	<br><br>
	&emsp;&emsp;My elementary days was spent in
	<a href = "Elem.html" target = "_balnk">Binmaley North Elementary School</a>,
	where I found "mathematics subject is the very dangerous subject in learning", quoted by others.
	As time passes by, my Math subject includes the multiplication and division, and I promised myself to do
	better in my every subject and I considered it as a challenge to myself. And when I am turning grade 4
	my teachers found out that I am doing very well in the Math subject. But my hated subject is Science,
	because my teacher doesn't fit the subject.
	<br><br>
	&emsp;&emsp;Highschool and Senior Highschool are the happiest stage of learning, since your classmates are
	idiot enough to do multiple pranks to their favorite prey. Having good friends that sticks beside you until
	they found their crushes and you are now a "set-aside".
	<a href = "High.html" target = "_balnk">Binmaley Catholic School</a>
	is a very famous school in our place since it is the only private high school nearby. Actually, I walked a
	lot of times when my class ends for me to save money, the payment of tricycle to my home was <b>Php 8.00</b>
	it was worth saving money for a 30 minutes walk. And my senior high days was spent on the other building of
	my recent school but it is still its part with the name
	<a href = "Seniorhigh.html" target = "_balnk">Binmaley Catholic High School</a>, it's a big difference.
